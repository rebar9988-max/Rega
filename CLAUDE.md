# REGA — working rules for Claude Code

These rules come from the project owner and apply to every task in this repository.

## 1. Foundation rule (REGA is a finished house)
- The foundation is fixed. Architecture and structure are not changed without a real reason.
- Routing and navigation are not disturbed by small requests.
- A design change must not change the system's foundation.
- Adding a feature = adding only that feature. Moving a section must not move other parts of REGA.
- Never re-design the architecture from scratch. Existing functionality must be preserved.
- Only if a fundamental change is truly necessary: first assess its impact on the foundation.

## 2. Strict task scope
- Do only what the task explicitly asks. Nothing outside its scope.
- No unrequested: refactors, database migrations or schema changes, routing/architecture changes, header/footer/
  navigation changes, design-system/typography/colour changes, new features, or clean-ups for taste.
- If another change is truly required for the task: understand why, make only that change, keep it directly tied
  to the task.
- Within the task there is professional freedom for layout, placement, spacing, alignment, sizing, responsive
  behaviour, accessibility, UX and performance, as long as REGA's visual identity, architecture and existing
  functionality are preserved.
- Flow: AUDIT -> UNDERSTAND -> CHANGE ONLY THE REQUESTED SCOPE -> TEST -> VERIFY. Report only task-related changes.

## 3. Design preservation
- REGA's visual identity is locked: colour palette, the REGA red, backgrounds, typography, Kurdish font, borders,
  radius, cards, icons, header/footer identity, buttons, navigation, spacing, light/dark mode, RTL behaviour.
- No new colours, gradients, glassmorphism, neon, generic templates or a new visual language.
- Layout/composition may be improved; identity may not.

## 4. Sequential task execution
- Several tasks in one prompt are executed in order: Task 1 -> verify -> Task 2 -> verify -> ... -> final verification.
- For each task: inspect the relevant code, implement, run the needed test/typecheck/build, verify it works, then
  continue. Do not wait for a new prompt between tasks unless explicitly told to stop.
- A directly related problem found during a task is fixed, then work continues.
- A task is never "done" before it is verified. If it truly cannot be completed, diagnose first, then report the
  task and the reason.
- Final report: completed tasks, changed files, test/build/typecheck results, incomplete tasks and why.

## 5. Safety (always)
- Never expose, print, commit or ask for secrets. Never reset, drop, truncate or delete production data.
- No fake data, fake links, invented handles, fake brand assets or placeholder icons in production.
